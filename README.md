> **NOTE:**
>  I developed this project as part of my application to become a member of OmahTI (Organisasi Mahasiswa Ahli Teknologi Informasi | **Student Organization of Information Technology**), for the 2022 Cohort at Universitas Gadjah Mada.

## 🚧 Initial Plan & Decision Making

In this assignment project, my initial plan was to use `nextJS + tailwindCSS`. I started implementing it step by step. However, due to some technical issues and rendering errors, which consumed a lot of my debugging time, I reconsidered the tech stack. Given the simplicity of the static web requirements, I pivoted to focus on MVP.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **TailwindCSS**: There was a hiccup with Tailwind's NPM and its CLI. Even though I faced no issues in a previous project, I had to resort to using a CDN this time, even if it's not ideal for larger projects.

## 🎨 Design & Features

### FIGMA

I began with the Figma design, which the committee graciously provided. I took the initiative to expand the prototype across multiple resolutions.

### 🔍 Responsive Design

The website is responsive, supporting designs from mobile to desktop (2xl). The designs closely mirror the provided mockups. In terms of coding in Tailwind, I took a mobile-first approach.

### 🎈 Interactions: Hover & Click Animations

There are animations across various elements - buttons, cards, titles, and navigation elements. The animations are smooth, and they function perfectly in both light and dark modes.

### 💌 Mailto & Hyperlinks

Several elements, when clicked, will redirect users to specific websites. It's like an easter egg hunt, so feel free to explore!

### 🌓 Dark Mode

A trendy feature that greatly enhances user experience. The dark mode setting is determined by your device/browser settings. If your device is set to light mode, the website will display in light mode, and vice versa.

### 🖼️ Content & Images

Compliant with the project's criteria of incorporating grayscale images, I sourced the latest content from IG OmahTI. As for the writer's image, I used a formal photo from OmahTI.



## 📚 Lessons & Takeaways

- Writing clean and concise code.
- Enhancing code readability, especially when working with utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind.
- The significance of MVP in time-constrained projects.
- Efficient use of HTML tags and CSS classes to reduce redundancy.
- Grasping the essentials of responsive design techniques and the box model.
- The importance of a foundational understanding of UI/UX.

Although I've gleaned much from this project, I acknowledge there might still be areas of improvement. As always, the learning never stops! 😄
